Heya, Nikhil here. I am an aspiring developer currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at St. Joseph's College in Bangalore, India.

I have been into computers and technology for as far as I can remember. In 2018 I was introduced to the beautiful world of web development, since then I have spent a fair amount of time teaching myself how to build clean and robust web applications on a daily basis. Over the years I have picked up several languages and frameworks while building applications for clients and myself.

I feel most comfortable working with backend development, however, I am pleased to say that I am equally good with the frontend :) 

I daily drive the Linux Operating System (I use Arch BTW), which has led me to explore various tools that go into deploying web applications while being mindful of server security as well. I have also dabbled extensively with web scraping and automation in the past.

I currently have experience with the following technologies:

<div className="grid grid-cols-6">
  <div className="col-span-3 md:col-span-2">
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - TypeScript
    - PHP
    - Python
    - Laravel
    - Django
    - ExpressJS
  </div>

  <div className="col-span-3 md:col-span-2">
    
    - FastAPI
    - Vue
    - React
    - Svelte
    - NextJS
    - NuxtJS
    - TailwindCSS
    - BulmaCSS
    - Bootstrap
  </div>

  <div className="col-span-3 md:col-span-1">
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL
    - Docker
    - Linux
    - MongoDB
    - Nginx
    - HAProxy
  </div>
</div>

When I am not coding, I spend time watching television, learning about astronomy, listening to music and playing video games.
