### [OnePercent Software](https://onepercent.club)
    #### Internship Work
    At OnePercent software, I was tasked with the job of creating a code compilation system to serve as a backend for their e-learning mobile apps. 
    These apps allowed users to type out code in a variety of programming languages which was then sent to a backend for compilation, the resultant output was sent back to the user via the mobile app. 
    Security was of paramount importance since a malicious user could perform remote code execution attacks on the server due to how the code compilation was being handled. 
    To overcome this issue Docker containers were used to provide an isolated environment where the code could be executed securely without being a threat to the server. 
    I also helped mitigate other security issues such as dealing with long-running code with infinite loops, etc.
